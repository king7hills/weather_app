# weather_app
TOP Weather App Project

The focus here is on using API calls as well as promise functionality. I relied on async/await syntax for this project.

The app is very minimally styled. My focus is on the javascript and correctly utilizing API calls.

Here a user can input a location. Provided they spell the location correctly, they will get the weather
of that location, and a corresponding GIF which is linked to the weather condition at that location.
If the user misspells their location, the application will ask them to double check their spelling and
throw an error to the console.

The data displays only the current weather for a particular location.

Default location is Nashville, TN USA which will appear if the user does not enter any text.
